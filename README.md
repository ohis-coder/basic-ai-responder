# AI Personal Assistant Project

This project demonstrates the creation of a simple AI model from scratch that responds to the input "Good Morning" using basic machine learning concepts such as logits, probabilities, and temperature. 

## Files:
- `goodmorningAI.py`: Python code for AI model.
- `README.md`: Project description.

## Technologies:
- Python
- NumPy

## How to Run:
1. Install dependencies (e.g., `pip install numpy`).
2. Run the script using `python3 goodmorningAI.py`.
